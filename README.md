# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates **Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm** in Python.  
The main idea is to divide customers into meaningful groups based on their spending behavior and demographic data. This helps businesses to target customers with better marketing strategies and personalized offers.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer Segmentation is one of the most important applications of **unsupervised machine learning**.  
In this project, we use the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group customers who share similar traits such as age, annual income, and spending score.  
This helps businesses find valuable customer clusters and improve decision-making. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧠 What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised ML algorithm used to group data points into **K clusters**.  
It works by finding the **centroids** of clusters such that the sum of distances between the points and their centroids is minimized. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as:

- Customer ID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Annual Income (in k$)  
- Spending Score (1-100)

The data is used to find patterns and group customers into clusters based on their behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

This project is implemented using:

- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithm  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Import required libraries  
2. Load and explore the dataset  
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Clean and preprocess the data  
5. Use the **Elbow Method** to find optimal clusters  
6. Apply K-Means Clustering  
7. Visualize and interpret the clusters

📊 Results & Insights

The customers are segmented into distinct groups.

Each cluster represents a specific type of customer behavior.

Cluster analysis helps identify:

High spenders

Average spenders

Low spenders

Young and active customers

🚀 Future Enhancements

This project can be extended by:

Applying other clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical, DBSCAN)

Deploying as a web application

Using different business datasets for varied analysis
